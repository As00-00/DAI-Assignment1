# DAI-Assignment1

This repository contains a data analysis pipeline that covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. The project demonstrates how to handle missing values, detect and remove outliers, and analyze relationships between variables using statistical and visual techniques.

# Project Structure

# Tasks Performed

# 1. Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values (imputation for numerical, categorical fill-in).

Removing duplicate records.

Detecting and treating outliers using IQR method.

Standardizing categorical values.

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Univariate Analysis: Summary statistics, frequency distributions, histograms, and box plots.

Bivariate Analysis: Correlation matrix, scatter plots, bar plots, and violin plots.

Multivariate Analysis: Pair plots, heatmaps, and grouped comparisons.
